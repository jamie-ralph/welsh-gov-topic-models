# Topic modelling of Welsh Government announcements

This repository contains code for a proof-of-concept pipeline I developed which
web scrapes announcements published on gov.wales and performs topic modelling on
the processed text.

You can read the final report in [this markdown file](Topic-modelling-of-Welsh-Government-announcements-in-2020.md) where I used both R and Python. The original Python version can be found in [this notebook](topic-modelling-wg-announcements.ipynb).
The web scraping code can be found in the **data-collection** folder.
